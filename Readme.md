## A Chop Shop for QBCore Framework
Features :
- The random location gives a 200 wide slightly transparent blue blip over the approximate vehicle location.  The vehicle can be anywhere within that zone, and the zone moves around the vehicle location.
- All locations and vehicles easily configurable in the Config file.
- Won't assign the same vehicle or location twice in a row.
- Utilized the vehicle bones for QB-Target Exports to only show on assigned vehicle, and only usable in assigned Chop Shop Zone
